*' @description The regglo_apr20 realization contains different interest rate
*' scenarios. In the default setting, the interest rate depends on the development
*' state `im_development_state`, which is calculated based on GDP per capita.
*' Thus, interest rates are regionally specific and dynamic over time.
*' Alternatively, global interest rate scenarios can be selected, in which
*' interest rates are identical in all regions.
*' The initial global interest rate is 7% (in 1995) for all scenarios defined in `scen12`.
*' It undergoes a transition towards 4%, 7% and 10% until 2030 for the low-, medium-
*' and high- interest rate scenarios, respectively.
